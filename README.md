# Time Series Analysis using Auto Regressive models

## 1. Subtask: Spectral Analysis w/ Yule-Walker Equations
- [ ] Compare peak heights and widths vs. order of AR model
- [ ] Compare spectral resolution vs. order of AR model and gap between peaks
- [ ] Compare spectral resolution vs. number of samples
- [ ] Compare with conventional FFT (maybe even in terns of computational speed)
